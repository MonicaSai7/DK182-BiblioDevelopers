#### Bibliophile Companion - A companion similar to an active agent, that helps the reader to organize and retrieve the highlighted text, book marked page and credentials of the content source in cloud across heterogeneous platforms, gadgets and applications.</br>

To develop a software tool (may be an app/plug-in) that archives the highlighted text from different sources and enable the user to retrieve according to his requirement wherever and whenever required from centralized storage. </br>
#### Description: 
Now a days the flow of information have been exponentially increased, and the information flow from a variety of sources. When a reader needs to highlight the textual information and use it as and when it is required at later point in time, there exists no tool for him. It becomes even more complex when the source of information is from across multiple platforms, gadgets and applications. Therefore, Bibliophile Companion is proposed to address the problem. The important challenge in this problem is, the information source may be of any type (e.g. .pdf, .doc, .html, etc) and the source of information may be from any environment. To have a centralized access of stored information, cloud infrastructure based solution is to be provided.
