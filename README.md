The idea of our project is to use Amazon Web Services as a backend cloud infrastructure for the user highlighted data. All the user selected data that the system clipboard can hold will be accessed and stored in the cloud automatically. So, the user does not have to paste the selected data manually again. The project front-end is a web application which uses Django for its development and deployment. The user authentication for the login and registration aspects on the applications is developed using another Amazon Web Service - AWS Cognito. Each time a user sign’s up onto our application, he/she will receive a confirmation mail. Only after the mail confirmation will he/she be allowed to access the storage or use the application. The functionality of retrieving selected/highlighted data has been implemented using Python programming language which enables that, every time a user starts a session and highlights any text document of any format, the data will be saved in a new file until the end session is clicked on again. This works on any kind of file source/format. The files that are created to store the user’s selected content will be stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
